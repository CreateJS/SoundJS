****************************************************************************************************
Second release, corresponding with the release of the CreateJS suite of tools (createjs.com).
This version includes a target plugin model that abstracts audio playback to various plugins, which
can be prioritized. Other updates include controllable sound instances, which are returned when a
sound is played, providing a much easier way to control audio once it has started playback.
