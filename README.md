# SoundJS

SoundJS is a library to make working with audio on the web easier. It provides a consistent API for playing audio in different browsers, including using a target plugin model to provide an easy way to provide additional audio plugins like Web Audio, and a Flash fallback. A mechanism has been provided for easily tying in audio preloading to PreloadJS (http://preloadjs.com)

## Classes

### [SoundJS](http://createjs.com/Docs/SoundJS/SoundJS.html)
The core API for playing sounds. Simply call SoundJS.play(sound, options), and a sound instance is created that can be used to control the audio, and receive events when it is complete, loops, or is interrupted.

### [SoundInstance](http://createjs.com/Docs/SoundJS/SoundInstance.html)
A controllable sound object that wraps the actual plugin implementation, providing a consistent API for audio playback, no matter what happens in the background. Sound instances can be paused, muted, and stopped, and the volume, pan (where available), and position using the simple API.

### [HTMLAudioPlugin](http://createjs.com/Docs/SoundJS/HTMLAudioPlugin.html)
The default, built-in plugin, which manages audio playback via the HTML5 <audio> tag.

### [FlashPlugin](http://createjs.com/Docs/SoundJS/FlashPlugin.html)
An additional plugin which uses a flash shim (and SWFObject) to playback audio using Flash.
